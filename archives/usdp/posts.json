When Joe Gangelhoff needed a professional tee that lasted more than a season, he took matters into his own hands and designed the G Tee. It’s made for every softball player out there who wants a tee that will withstand thousands and thousands of hits, swing after swing, season after season. It lives up to Joe’s original goal, and then some.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The single best batting tee on the market, this <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\">American-made, award-winning softball tee</a> is loved by pros and those aspiring to make their mark. Check out what goes into making it your favorite softball batting tee. G Tee…what Pros use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Stays In Place</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Softball pros love G Tee batting tees because, simply put, they stay in place. Swing after swing, the high density plastic or stainless steel bases (depending on your hitting surface) offer a stable and consistent hitting experience that doesn’t walk or move at all. There’s no need to stop what you’re doing, put it back in place, and start swinging again -- it just stays put.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Easily Adjustable Height</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>G Tee softball batting tees also have the widest adjustable telescoping heights on the market with three sizes ranging from <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-classic-batting-tee/?attribute_pa_height=18-30-46cm-76cm\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-classic-batting-tee/?attribute_pa_height=18-30-46cm-76cm\">18” - 30”</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-classic-batting-tee/?attribute_pa_height=22-41-56cm-104cm\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-classic-batting-tee/?attribute_pa_height=22-41-56cm-104cm\">22” - 41”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-classic-batting-tee/?attribute_pa_height=26-53-66cm-135cm\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-classic-batting-tee/?attribute_pa_height=26-53-66cm-135cm\">26” - 53”</a>.

Not with G Tee’s batting tees. Every single part of the tee is repairable or replaceable, which means you can hang onto your tee and just replace a part rather than throwing the whole thing away and buying a new one.

    "Title": "How to Improve Batting Accuracy",
    "Content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Improving your batting average is always the goal. Though it can sometimes seem out of reach, there are ways you can improve your batting accuracy. Along with <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-batting-tee/\">using the right batting tee</a> for practice, there are some simple adjustments you can make that will have a big impact. Keep reading for tips on how to improve your batting accuracy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Keep Your Mind In the Game</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Much of your baseball performance depends on focus and being present during the game. As you increase your confidence at the plate and on the field, you’ll start to see a noticeable change. Keep in mind that distractions big and small can have an impact, from throwing off your timing or stance to missing a catch or making a game-changing error. Leave all distractions in the locker room and head out onto the field with confidence for every game and every practice.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Choose the Right Bat</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When holding your bat, it should feel comfortable in your hands as well as throughout your swing. It shouldn’t be too heavy or too light. Spend some time holding and swinging bats of different weights to find one that feels best for you.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your bat should also be the right length. To find the right length, measure from the center of your chest through to the index finger of your outstretched primary arm. This measurement should be the length of your bat (most adults are between 33 and 34 inches). You can also hold the end of your bat in your hand at your side. If it touches the ground and your palm can rest on the top of the handle, the bat is the right length.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tip: When adjusting to a new bat length, only go up or down one inch at a time to keep your swing steady.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Work on Timing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having the perfect swing can be great, but if it’s too early or too late when the ball arrives it won’t be successful. To improve your timing and hit the ball when it arrives, stay moving at the plate. Move your knees and elbows and stay limber. As the ball leaves the pitcher’s hand, begin your swing. The better you get at determining good pitches or balls at speed, you can swing or let it go by, but continuing to move will prepare you for whatever the pitch might be.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Have a Consistent Stance</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Along with constant motion, a consistent stance within the batter’s box has two major benefits. First, you’ll have the ability to make quick adjustments for strike zone pitches in any quadrant. You’ll need to be flexible enough in your stance to hit both near and outer strike zone pitches, but you’ll still need to be at the right distance to know if a ball is outside the zone. Second, a consistent stance will make it easier for you to know if adjustments are needed prior to your swing. Work with your coach on your stance and make sure to keep it consistent throughout your time at bat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Practice Often</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You’ve heard the saying ‘practice makes perfect.’ While no one is perfect, your batting accuracy will improve with practice. Practice often, and make each practice count. Work with your coach to watch your swing and make suggestions for improvement. Work with your team’s pitchers as they throw in the bullpen. Use the batting cage to prepare you for additional pitches and speeds. Keep at it, and you’ll start to notice positive changes in your batting accuracy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take a look at some of our top batting tees, like the <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-batting-tee/\">G Tee</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-triad/\">G Tee Triad</a>, and you’ll see why the pros love them.

Not only does it need to stay upright, but it also needs to stay put in the same spot on the ground. Constantly making adjustments to its placement can throw batters off their game and prevent them from perfecting their stance. Most tees wobble, walk and move when used in practice, but G Tee tees, like the <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-triad/\">G Tee Triad</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-quad/\">G Tee Quad</a>, are made to stay in place.

Every <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/g-tees/\">G Tee</a> is made to last swing after swing, year after year. If something on your tee does break or need repair, it’s repairable or replaceable, even the flexible rubber cup.

    "Title": "Is Using a Batting Tee Helpful for Practice?",
    "Content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether you're a seasoned baseball or softball veteran or a beginner just starting out, practicing your batting skills is essential for success. But what's the best way to practice? Some people believe that using a <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\">batting tee</a> is the most effective way to improve their batting accuracy and power while others prefer live pitching. We believe that a combination of the two is most useful for improving your swing, accuracy and winning the game. Let’s take a look at why both are beneficial.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Benefits of Practicing With a Tee</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Practicing your hitting with a batting tee has several great benefits. One of the main benefits of using a batting tee is that it allows you to focus specifically on your batting technique. With a live pitcher, there are many other factors that can influence your batting performance such as the speed and accuracy of the pitch, the type of pitch (fastball, curveball, etc.), and the movement of the ball. With a batting tee, you can eliminate these variables and focus solely on perfecting your batting form, from stance to swing, follow through and hip rotation. You can also determine the best hitting height for your swing and improve hand-eye coordination.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another benefit of practicing with a tee is that it enables you to hit the ball with greater power. This is because you can use your body weight to drive through the ball, rather than relying on the speed and momentum of the pitch to propel the ball. This is especially beneficial for beginners who may not have the batting strength to hit a live pitch with power.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Batting tees are also perfect for solo practice. Whether practicing your swing at the park on a weekend or getting your swing reps in at practice, a batting tee gives you the freedom to go solo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>When to Use a Live Pitcher for Practice</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to practicing your swing, it’s helpful to use a range of resources, including a live pitcher. A live pitcher can provide a more realistic experience to a game, and players can learn to adjust their swing to different types of pitches in real time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have access to a live pitcher, that’s great! Work them into your practice schedule. When they’re not available, use your batting tee to work on your form, your swing and hitting power.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While batting tees offer many advantages over live pitching, it’s also helpful to incorporate live pitching into your training. When shopping for a <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/g-tees/\">batting tee</a>, make sure to consider the types of pitches you want to practice hitting.

    "Content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the most important skills in baseball or softball is being able to successfully hit the ball. There are many techniques that you can use to improve your batting skills, but one of the most effective tools is a <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\">batting tee</a>. In this post, we'll discuss how to use a batting tee to improve your batting skills. We will also provide some tips on how to select the right batting tee for your needs. Read on to find out how to get the most from your batting tee and perfect your swing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Setting Up Your Tee</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When using a batting tee for any sport, whether it’s baseball, softball, or little league, you’ll want to be sure to set it up correctly. If the tee is not properly set up, it will be much more difficult to hit the ball. When setting up your tee, place the batting tee so that the ball is aligned with the center of your body, slightly above your waist. This will help you hit the ball at the optimum height. For more specifics on the best tee and ball height for you, check out our blog on <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/how-high-should-a-batting-tee-be/\">how high your batting tee should be</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Perfecting Your Stance</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have the batting tee set up correctly, it's time to focus on your batting stance. The best batting stance will vary depending on your batting style and preferences, but there are a few key elements that all good batting stances have in common. First, you want to make sure that your feet are shoulder-width apart and your weight is evenly distributed. This will give you a good foundation for your swing. Next, point your toes in the direction that you want to hit the ball. Finally, bend your knees slightly and lean forward so that your bat is pointing toward the batting tee.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Making Contact With the Ball</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that you're in the proper batting stance, it's time to focus on making contact with the ball. When swinging, start with your bat above your shoulder, keeping your elbow up, and bring the bat down in a smooth, controlled motion. As you make contact with the ball, be sure to follow through with your swing. This will help ensure that you make solid contact and that the ball goes where you want it to.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Finding the Right Tee</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\">G Tee</a>, we pride ourselves on making the <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\">best baseball and softball batting tees</a>, and we have them all, from <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/g-tees/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/g-tees/\">single tees</a> to <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/triple-tees/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/triple-tees/\">triple tees</a> that stay put swing after swing to portable tees that go wherever you go.

    "Content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’ve shopped around for a batting tee before, you know there are quite a few brands out there including ours, the <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\">G Tee</a>, and those from Tanner Tees. We often get questions about the differences between our tees and those from the competition, so we wanted to break it down and allow you to make the best decision for your game.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>G Tee vs. Tanner Tees</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Batting tees are designed to hold up a ball so the batter can practice hitting it. Whether it’s being used for softball or baseball batting practice, it should hold the ball and provide a platform from which to hit. While all tees can do this basic need, it’s the other aspects of the tee where one brand can win or lose over other tees.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Stability</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When hitting a baseball or softball from a batting tee, stability is key. A tee that stays in place swing after swing allows the batter to stay in place, too. This helps in practicing stance, hitting consistency and nailing down range of motion. If the batting tee “walks” or moves with every swing, it can be a hassle each time it needs to be readjusted back into place.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/\">G Tee batting tees</a> are designed with two different base plate options, each designed to keep the tee stable on any surface.

This allows the user to alter the height of the ball throughout practice in order to gain experience hitting a range of balls. It also lets the user set the height at the perfect level for the batter to practice stance and swing. Tees without telescoping heights make the batter conform to the tee, which isn’t ideal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All telescoping tees are not considered equal, however. The best tees are those that stay at the same height hit after hit, until the user adjusts it otherwise. Many telescoping tees, however, droop over time due to the drying out of rubber chair bottoms that are meant to keep it in place.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At G Tee, all of our tees include the telescoping feature, and they’re engineered with patented seals and bushings at the core of the upright that keep it at the same height swing after swing, season after season.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Easy on the Environment &amp; Your Budget</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When shopping around for baseball or softball batting tees, you’ll want to make sure the one you select is going to last. There’s nothing worse than buying a tee and realizing it needs to be replaced after a few months' time or at the start of next season. Unfortunately this happens a lot, so it’s important to do your homework.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At G Tee, we understand the need for a tee that’s going to last, so we engineer all of our tees to do just that. Each of our tees is backed by a <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/warranty-repair/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/warranty-repair/\">2-year warranty</a> that covers all parts, labor and wear and tear, including the <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/accessories/g-tee-rubber-cup/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/accessories/g-tee-rubber-cup/\">rubber cup</a>.

Every single part of a G Tee tee is replaceable, so instead of throwing away the whole thing and starting from scratch like is common with so many competitors’ tees, you can simply order the replacement part at a fraction of the price and get practicing again in no time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Bonus</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We mentioned the <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/accessories/g-tee-rubber-cup/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/accessories/g-tee-rubber-cup/\">rubber cup</a> is warrantied and replaceable, but we want to highlight the best part about it – it can be replaced and used again in minutes vs. the 24-hour set time needed for competitor tees.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to batting tees, whether for baseball or softball, G Tee is the obvious choice.

    "Title": "Ultimate Guide to Selecting a Batting Tee",
    "Content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, you need a baseball tee but don’t know where to start. We get it, it’s a daunting process. Even with ample research, it can be hard to figure out just which tee is perfect for you or your player. This Ultimate Guide will get you started on the path to making the right choice. We will discuss:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>What is a batting tee and why you need one</li><li>Types of batting tees</li><li>Things to look for in a batting tee</li><li>Why the G Tee</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What is a batting tee and why you need one</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A batting tee is a simple tool used to work on hitting baseballs. It consists of a base, stem and ball holder. The base, which is usually shaped like home plate, anchors the tee. The stem is an adjustable staff that connects the base to the ball holder. The ball holder does exactly what it says: holds the ball!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Batting tees are necessary because they help you develop the important skills within hitting. As opposed to working with live pitches and working on timing, the batting tee lets you work on pure mechanics and form. By slowing the ball down (to 0 MPH), you can work on the motions and movements that will give you the best chance at hitting the ball far. It’s also a great opportunity to give your bats some use so they are better in-game. It’s a great way to get reps in a smaller area while working on your hitting. It’s easy to use, accessible, and valuable at every age and skill level.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Types of batting tees</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a variety of batting tee types. Finding the right one is essential for getting the most out of your batting tee experience. Some types are:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>- Classic tees. These are the standard tees you think of when you hear “batting tee.” They are effective, tried and true. They work very well and are perfect for all ages, skill levels and sizes.<br>- Hybrid tees. Hybrid tees hold the ball from the top using an extended arm around the strike zone. The hybrid tee helps correct players who may have a choppy swing on a regular tee. It is effective for anyone who needs to work on hitting, though.<br>- Training tees. These often expensive tees connect the ball to the training machine and therefore require no retrieval of the ball. It’s great for getting in hundreds of reps at once, without having to get the ball every time.<br>- Concept tees. Concept tees help you work on a specific facet of your game. There are many types, but they all work on forcing you to think about the mechanics of your swing and the way you swing the bat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Things to look for in a batting tee</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are lots of things you should look for in a batting tee, but here are some of the most vital ones:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>- Durability. This is a no-brainer. A batting tee gets abused by players constantly, so ensuring that you get a durable tee is important. You may think getting a cheaper one is fine, but they won’t last as long and you will lose money having to replace it over and over again. Get a well made, weighted tee to get the absolute best experience.<br>- Stability. Hitting a ball off of a tee that just moves when you hit it defeats the purpose. You can buy weights for unstable tees, but ultimately, just getting a weighted tee at the beginning prevents you from taking an unnecessary step. Keep in mind that heavier tees are harder to transport! Lightweight tees are great for use wherever you are in the world, but those tend to be less stable. However, they have their own benefits! Try to find a balance between ease of use and stability when choosing a tee.<br>- Portability. As mentioned, moving a tee can be a lot of work. They can weigh up to 10 pounds and are sometimes large and bulky. Keep this in mind when choosing a tee! If you are getting one for little kids to use to get the basics down, there’s no need for a “pro” weighted tee. However, heavier, fancier tees are going to require a lot of muscle to move around, so be prepared to put in the elbow grease.<br>Versatility. Getting a versatile batting tee is only for those who need it. However, lots of batting tees are suited for use in other sports like softball. If you need to use one tee for a variety of different players, investing in an adjustable tee that can accommodate different heights is vital. Lots of tees are very versatile, so finding one that isn’t a one-trick-pony is a good idea.<br>- Personability. You need to work with a company that provides what YOU deserve: good customer service. Ensure you’re buying from a company that can assist with warranty, repair and maintenance issues. Buying a tee isn’t easy, and working with a bad company can make it even harder. Make sure you focus on your needs and interact with a company that can help you!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Why the G Tee</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The G Tee checks every box on your list.

A batting tee can provide feedback on your swing mechanics and help you see where you are making mistakes or need improvement. A baseball player who uses a batting tee will become more familiar with his or her own swing and learn how to correct mistakes that they might make while at bat during games.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>A batting tee is a handy tool that can help baseball players improve their batting skills.</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes, a batting tee is a handy tool that can help baseball players improve their batting skills. But what exactly is a batting tee? And what purpose does it serve?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The answer to these questions lies in understanding why baseball players use the tee. When you’re learning how to swing the bat, there are many different factors to consider: where your hands go, where your eyes look, which muscles are used to hit the ball, and so on. A hitting tee helps simplify this process by providing a stationary object for you to practice against as opposed to an actual pitcher or catcher. This will allow you focus on one specific aspect of hitting at a time before moving onto another aspect—for instance, when hitting with your eyes closed after being able to readjust them properly setting up with both feet in line and knees bent (focusing on balance).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After setting up correctly with both feet facing away from each other while also keeping knees bent slightly forward ready-set position stance arms back ready grip handle wiggle wrist relax shoulder rotate hips turn shoulder rotate hips turn shoulder rotate hips follow through.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Batting tees allow players to concentrate on their swing completely, which means they can provide feedback to themselves and identify areas of improvement.</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Batting tees allow players to focus on their swing completely, which means they can provide feedback to themselves and identify areas of improvement.

Because most batting tees are intended to simply reflect the pitching experience, you can use either baseballs or softballs in most major batting tees. This is the case with the G-Tee! Both batting coaches from softball and baseball teams have seen a lot of success with using G-Tees. It’s easy to set up and has the most realistic feel for batters. Regardless of what sport you play, there’s a G-Tee for you!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, you can and should consider your sport when making your decision about which G Tee to purchase:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For softball players, there’s a focus on precision and strength less than speed. For this, you may require a tee that is more secure or solid to the ground. Consider one of the more stable G Tee tees like the <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-pro-batting-tee/\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">Pro</mark></a> and the <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-pro-quad-batting-tee/\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">Pro Quad</mark></a>. Their sturdiness and large base make them perfect for training like a softball pro! You can simulate the pitching experience with ease and adjust the height for players of all sizes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For baseball players, almost any of the G Tees are perfect for you!

    "Content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When training for baseball and softball, using a batting tee is an essential tool for perfecting a swing. Players at every level swear by batting tees, and there are several reasons why. Let’s dive into some of the top reasons why players practice with a tee.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Perfect Your Swing Without Distractions</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Probably the most important feature, a <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/g-tees/\">batting tee</a> helps batters focus on just their swing. Without distractions, a player can focus on specific aspects of their swing that they want to improve. With a batting tee, you are fully in control and don’t have to worry about any variables a live pitcher brings. The consistency of a batting tee helps to eliminate the external factors that would otherwise keep you from improving your swing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Key is Repetition</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To best improve your swing, repeating the motion until it’s perfect is key. With a batting tee, a player can continuously repeat their swing and turn the best swing into second nature. Batting tees are <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/testimonials/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/testimonials/\">not just for players starting out</a>— even those in the Major League use batting tees to continue practicing.

Practicing with a batting tee means that you can go as slow or as fast as you want.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Practice On Your Own Time</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Without a partner or coach around, practicing for baseball or softball can seem tricky. Having a coach observe as you hit off a tee is beneficial, but a batting tee allows you to continue practice even on your own. Perfecting your swing requires dedication and repetition, which is why a batting tee is the perfect asset.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Batting Tees are Portable</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not only is a batting tee an essential tool, it is also easy to take with you.

    "Title": "How Do You Pick A Batting Tee?",
    "Content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Training with a batting tee is one of the most productive exercises for hitters. It’s a method that allows for constant repetition and focuses on just one skill. However, before you run out and get the first one you find, how do you pick a batting tee that's right for you? Let’s dive into some of the top qualities you should look for before purchasing a batting tee, as well as some of the different varieties offered.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>A Durable Tee</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The most important factor to consider when searching for a <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/g-tees/\">quality batting tee</a> is durability. A batting tee made with sturdy materials will last much longer and not start wearing down immediately. Batting tees made with high quality rubber and metal will last longer and withstand batting practice without cracks or tears.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How It Affects Your Bat</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Especially if you are using a wooden bat, a batting tee can potentially wear down your bat. Some batting tees use a plastic top to hold the ball, which will chip at wooden bats with every swing. A tee that uses a rubber top to hold the ball will prevent this. You’ll want to keep an eye out for flexible rubber tops, as they allow for a clean swing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>An Adjustable Tee</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most batting tees nowadays are adjustable in height. However, when picking a batting tee you want to be sure that it has a wide range it can adjust to. Being able to change the height of the ball on a tee allows you to practice smooth swings in a wide range. After all, not every pitch in a game will go perfectly down the middle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Base</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The base of a batting tee is what will ensure that it stays upright after the hitter makes contact. A weak base could mean having to constantly reset the equipment. Tees will have either a tripod or solid base, which sometimes have additional weights available to ensure it stays upright.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Batting Tee Varieties</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Odds are you’re looking for a <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/g-tees/g-tee-classic-batting-tee/\">classic batting tee</a> that will simply get the job done, but you’ll also discover that there is a wide variety of tees available on the market. Not only are there standard and professional tees, but there are also <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/triple-tees/\">triple tees</a> for quick and consistent repetition, as well as <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/low-ball-tees-attachments/\">low ball tees</a> for an even wider range of swinging practice.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With a batting tee, players of every skill level can perfect their swing.

Let’s go over what a pitching stick is, as well as how to use pitching sticks to improve your performance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What are pitching sticks?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/pitching-aids/g-tee-pitching-sticks/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/pitching-aids/g-tee-pitching-sticks/\">Pitching sticks</a> are a set of two poles with either square or triangular bases. An elastic band connects the two poles together, serving as a visual aid for the pitcher. G Tee’s pitching sticks are available in two sizes, 24 inches and 48 inches tall. The poles have multiple settings and the height of the band can be adjusted. Depending on how you plan on using the pitching sticks, you’ll likely find it handy to have multiple bands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to use Pitching Sticks</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/pitching-aids/g-tee-pitching-sticks/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/pitching-aids/g-tee-pitching-sticks/\">Pitching sticks</a> primarily serve as a target for a pitcher. If you don’t have a permanent rope set up, pitching sticks are a great dupe. If you do have a rope set up, pitching sticks are a great alternative that can easily be transported.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With pitching sticks, the elastic band can be set at a specific height for the pitcher to train. The 24 inch poles come with a band that can be adjusted from 10 to 26 inches, while the 48 inch poles can be adjusted from 10 to 50 inches in height. The pitcher can practice accuracy by hitting the elastic band. With multiple bands at varying heights, pitchers can practice making adjustments and hitting at various heights.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides accuracy, <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/pitching-aids/g-tee-pitching-sticks/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/shop/pitching-aids/g-tee-pitching-sticks/\">pitching sticks</a> can also be used to improve various mechanics. Players can use pitching sticks to improve stride height, posture, and balance. To practice stride height, place the pitching sticks one foot short of their optimal stride length, with the elastic band slightly below the pitcher’s knee height. To clear the band, the pitcher will have to drive off the mount and lift their stride leg high off the ground, improving their posture and stride.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Used at a higher level, the elastic band of the pitching sticks can be used to keep pitchers from leaning forward. If the pitcher struggles with balance, pitching sticks can be used as a barrier for balance at the end of the pitch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Benefit of Pitching Sticks</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not all pitching tools are able to help players train both their accuracy and mechanics.

    "Content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to batting practice, there is no greater tool than a batting tee. However, there are key things to avoid when hitting off a batting tee. Before diving in on what to avoid, let’s answer the most important question: why is a batting tee so important?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Why is a batting tee important? </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the greatest advantages to using a batting tee during practice is eliminating the variable of timing. By allowing players to focus solely on the movement of their swing, training can be much more precise.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While it is definitely useful to practice swings with a pitcher or even a pitching machine, each throw is bound to be slightly different. This can be disadvantageous for the hitter during practice, as they won’t be able to isolate particular aspects that can improve their swing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/batting-tee-use/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/batting-tee-use/\">benefits to using a batting tee</a>, but now let’s get into some of the key things to avoid when hitting off a tee.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Things to Avoid When Hitting off a Batting Tee</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the first things to avoid is setting up the tee too far back on the plate. Proper placement is necessary to practice hitting at the point of the swing where you’d be making contact if the ball were thrown. If the tee is too far back, contact will be made too early, and performance will suffer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next thing you should avoid is too much repetition. While a tee is great for consistent and repetitive practice, it is adjustable for a reason. Don’t be afraid to move the tee around and adjust the height. This will best prepare a batter for whatever may be thrown their way during a game.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When practicing with a <a href=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/g-tees/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.gteeusa.com/product-category/g-tees/\">batting tee</a>, avoid rushing. The ease of being able to swing and reset immediately seems ideal, but you want to be sure that you’re taking breaths in between swings and giving your body time to rebuild strength for the next swing. If you continuously swing without stopping, precision is likely to diminish.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another key thing to avoid is staying at the same level throughout practice. While hitting off the tee, it’s important to start off with warm ups, then increase intensity to a game-like energy. If you’re only using a batting tee with half-energy movements, there won’t be results in the game. By using the same strength, mechanics, and energy as if you were in the middle of a game, you’ll see direct improvements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With a batting tee, players of any skill level can perfect their swing.
